    // In order to pack them into one i32, we limit `worker_count` to (2^29)-1
    // (about 500 million) threads rather than (2^31)-1 (2 billion) otherwise
    // representable.
    //
    // The `worker_count` is the number of workers that have been permitted to
    // start and not permitted to stop. The value may be transiently different
    // from the actual number of live threads, for example when a thread
    // spawning fails to create a thread when asked, and when exiting threads
    // are still performing bookkeeping before terminating. The user-visible
    // pool size is reported as the current size of the workers set.
    //
    // The `lifecycle` provides the main lifecyle control, taking on values:
    //
    //   Running:    Accept new tasks and process queued tasks
    //   Shutdown:   Don't accept new tasks, but process queued tasks. This
    //               state is tracked by the work queue
    //   Stop:       Don't accept new tasks, don't process queued tasks, and
    //               interrupt in-progress tasks
    //   Tidying:    All tasks have terminated, worker_count is zero, the thread
    //               transitioning to state Tidying will run the terminated() hook
    //               method
    //   Terminated: terminated() has completed
    //
    // The numerical order among these values matters, to allow ordered
    // comparisons. The lifecycle monotonically increases over time, but need
    // not hit each state. The transitions are:
    //
    //   Running -> Shutdown
    //      On invocation of shutdown(), perhaps implicitly in finalize()
    //
    //   (Running or Shutdown) -> Stop
    //      On invocation of shutdown_now()
    //
    //   Shutdown -> Tidying
    //      When both queue and pool are empty
    //
    //   Stop -> Tidying
    //      When pool is empty
    //
    //   Tidying -> Terminated
    //      When the terminated() hook method has completed
    //
    // Threads waiting in await_termination() will return when the state reaches
    // Terminated.
    //
    // Detecting the transition from Shutdown to Tidying is less
    // straightforward than you'd like because the queue may become empty after
    // non-empty and vice versa during Shutdown state, but we can only
    // terminate if, after seeing that it is empty, we see that workerCount is
